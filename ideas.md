## Idea 1 — "Industrial Craft" (Brutalist-Meets-Craft Aesthetic)

**Design Movement:** Neo-Brutalism meets artisan craft — raw, honest materials paired with refined finishing touches, mirroring the painting trade itself.

**Core Principles:**
1. Bold typographic hierarchy with exposed structural elements
2. High-contrast black/white foundation with cyan as a surgical accent
3. Tactile textures — concrete, plaster, brushstroke overlays
4. Asymmetric layouts that break the grid to create visual tension

**Color Philosophy:** Jet black (#0A0A0A) as the dominant force, representing authority and expertise. Pure white (#FFFFFF) for breathing room. Cyan (#00B4D8) used sparingly as a "fresh paint" accent — it appears like a deliberate brushstroke on a dark canvas. Warm grey (#E8E4E0) for texture and depth.

**Layout Paradigm:** Full-bleed sections with dramatic scale shifts. Hero occupies 100vh with oversized typography. Content sections alternate between wide cinematic imagery and tight text columns pushed to one side. Services displayed in a staggered masonry-like grid.

**Signature Elements:**
1. Paint drip/brushstroke dividers between sections (subtle, not cartoonish)
2. Oversized section numbers (01, 02, 03) as background watermarks
3. Diagonal clip-path cuts on section transitions

**Interaction Philosophy:** Scroll-triggered reveals with staggered timing. Elements slide in from unexpected directions. Hover states on service cards reveal a "paint swipe" color transition.

**Animation:** Entrance animations use translateY with opacity fade, staggered by 100ms per element. Section transitions use clip-path reveals. Parallax on hero background image at 0.3x speed.

**Typography System:** Display: "Bebas Neue" (bold, condensed, industrial). Body: "DM Sans" (clean, modern, highly readable). The contrast between the two creates a "work meets precision" feel.

## Idea 2 — "Editorial Elegance" (Magazine-Style Sophistication)

**Design Movement:** Editorial design inspired by high-end architecture and interiors magazines — clean, spacious, and quietly luxurious.

**Core Principles:**
1. Generous whitespace as the primary design element
2. Photography-forward layout where images do the heavy lifting
3. Restrained typography with elegant serif/sans-serif pairing
4. Horizontal rhythm and column-based structure

**Color Philosophy:** Off-white (#FAFAF8) as the canvas — warmer than pure white, evoking freshly painted walls. Charcoal black (#1A1A1A) for text and structural elements. The cyan (#00B4D8) appears only in interactive elements and the logo, acting as the "signature color" — like an architect's blue pencil mark on a plan.

**Layout Paradigm:** Magazine-style columns with generous gutters. Hero section uses a split layout — large image on one side, headline on the other. Services presented in an editorial card layout with large photography. Testimonials in a pull-quote style with oversized quotation marks.

**Signature Elements:**
1. Thin horizontal rules as section dividers (editorial style)
2. Pull-quote typography for key statistics and testimonials
3. Image frames with subtle inner shadows suggesting depth

**Interaction Philosophy:** Understated and refined. Smooth scroll with eased transitions. Hover states use subtle scale (1.02) and shadow depth changes. Nothing flashy — confidence through restraint.

**Animation:** Fade-in-up on scroll with 600ms ease-out. Images reveal with a subtle scale from 1.05 to 1.0. Text appears line-by-line for key headlines. No bounce, no overshoot — everything is measured.

**Typography System:** Display: "Playfair Display" (elegant serif, suggests quality). Body: "Inter" (clean, neutral, professional). Numbers and stats: "Space Grotesk" (modern, technical). The serif/sans pairing says "premium service, professional execution."

## Idea 3 — "Bold Contrast" (High-Impact Modern Trade)

**Design Movement:** Contemporary high-contrast design — inspired by modern construction/trade branding that's bold, direct, and unapologetically confident.

**Core Principles:**
1. Dark-mode dominant with strategic light sections for contrast
2. Large-scale imagery with overlay treatments
3. Bold, direct copywriting paired with strong visual hierarchy
4. Card-based service presentation with hover interactions

**Color Philosophy:** Deep black (#0D0D0D) as the hero and primary sections — authoritative, professional, "jetblack." Off-white (#F5F5F0) for alternating content sections. Cyan (#00AACC) as the action color — buttons, links, highlights. A warm accent (#D4A574) for testimonial sections, evoking freshly sanded timber and renovation warmth.

**Layout Paradigm:** Full-width hero with dark overlay on photography. Content sections alternate dark/light creating a rhythmic scroll experience. Services in a 3-column card grid with icon illustrations. About section uses a side-by-side layout with team imagery. Contact section returns to dark theme for a strong closing.

**Signature Elements:**
1. Cyan accent lines/borders used as "paint strokes" to highlight key elements
2. Before/after image sliders for project showcases
3. Floating CTA button that follows scroll

**Interaction Philosophy:** Confident and direct. Buttons have strong hover states with background color shifts. Cards lift on hover with shadow depth. Scroll progress indicator in the brand cyan color.

**Animation:** Elements enter with a quick 400ms slide-up. Service cards stagger in sequence. Counter animations for statistics (years experience, projects completed). Smooth scroll-linked opacity changes on the hero section.

**Typography System:** Display: "Outfit" (geometric, modern, strong). Body: "Source Sans 3" (professional, readable, versatile). The combination feels contemporary and trustworthy — a modern trade business, not a generic contractor.

## Selected Approach: Idea 3 — "Bold Contrast"

This approach best aligns with the Jetblack brand identity. The dark-mode hero and alternating sections create visual drama that matches the "Jetblack" name. The cyan accent from the logo becomes the action color throughout. The bold, direct style communicates confidence and professionalism — exactly what homeowners and property managers want from a painting contractor.

**Key Design Decisions:**
- Dark hero section with full-width photography and text overlay
- Alternating dark/light sections for visual rhythm
- Cyan (#00AACC) as the primary action/accent color
- "Outfit" for headlines, "Source Sans 3" for body text
- Card-based service presentation
- Strong CTA presence throughout
- Mobile-first responsive design
