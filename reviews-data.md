"Jimmy and the team at jetblack painting were amazing to deal with from start to finish. Everything was easy and nothing was a problem, the workmanship is outstanding and I always receive compliments on our beautifully fresh painted home. Will be using Jimmy and his team for all future projects!"

### Review 2 - Tony (5 stars, 11 Jul 2021)
"I just moved into my new house and the previous painter had done a very poor job. I called Jet Black and I'm over the moon with the job Jimmy has done! Very polite and professional. Thank you JetBlack"
**Reply from Jetblack Painting:** "Dear Tony, thanks so much for your great review"

### Review 3 - Helen (5 stars, 11 Jul 2021)
"Jimmy from Jet Black Painting has completely transformed our old home, inside and out. It feels like a brand new house thanks to Jimmy's top level painting skills and attention to detail. Jimmy was also very friendly and professional, keeping us updated each day as the project progressed. We look forward to having Jimmy back again for our future projects."
**Reply from Jetblack Painting:** "Thanks for the awesome review Helen! It was a real pleasure painting your home and we're happy to hear we hit the mark for you. Cheers!"
